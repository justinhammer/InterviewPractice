# InterviewPractice

After taking a coding test on HackerRank last night, I realized that it would be really useful
to start keeping track of all the different quizes/puzzles/whiteboard problems that I run into
as I apply for various positions. This repository is intended to be a place where I can keep 
my practice problems. And hopefully this can serve as a resource that others may use who happen
to come across it.
